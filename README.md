## Getting started:
In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

In the server directory, you can run:

### `nodemon`
The Server will start on port http://localhost:5005 and connect to Mongo with the Database name: "phonecave"

The App is about showing details from different Phones using a RestAPI.

If I had more time I would add more CSS with TailwindCSS.
